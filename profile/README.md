  Integrated lab solutions for an open science lab

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It is our mission to stimulate innovation and inclusiveness in natural sciences by helping academics to make their laboratory data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). In addition to supporting research data management, we aim to make the workflow from raw data to processed data more transparent, accessible, and customizable.

*"Good data management is not a goal in itself, but rather is the key conduit leading to knowledge discovery and innovation, and to subsequent data and knowledge integration and reuse by the community after the data publication process." **Mark D. Wilkinson et al. 2016 Nature Scientific Data***

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The **integrated lab** is a solution to centralize data management of the traditional unconnected lab by collecting and harmonizing data streams from various lab instruments, and by providing open-sourced alternatives for routine analytical workflows. These routine analytics are now often locked away in a plethora of vendor supplied software suits.
